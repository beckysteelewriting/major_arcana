The Lovers

Inspiration: The Brady Tarot by Rachel Pollack

Pre-writing meaning:

Love, passion, joining together of opposites, wild exuberance
Relationship, particularly when about a partner
The merging of love and danger
A choice between virtue or vice
Desire and passion take us beyond deliberation and choice
Passion is blessed b/c it is an expression of nature
