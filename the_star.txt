The Star

Inspiration: The Brady Tarot by Rachel Pollack

Pre-writing meaning:
Question: Are you able to see the brightness you have within, that part of yourself that deserves love and belonging?
Rest after a big accomplishment or major life experience
A sense of freedom, calm, confidence, especially after a crisis
Realization that we are a part of nature
Flowing energy, nothing held back
Enjoy the moment
