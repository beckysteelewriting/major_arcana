The Tower

Inspired by: The Fountain Tarot by Saiz, Gruhl, Todaro

Question: Can you hear the rumble before a situation changes your life for good?
The tower has become ugly, overcomplicated, and out of balance
Change is necessary and painful, and this one will be felt for a very, very long time
Unexpected devestation, ways of being gone bankrupt, self-deception
Loss of security
Fears realized

It has come
The reckoning
Years of surgeries
Malnutrition, misdiagnoses
Years of your life
Chipped off
Stolen by disease
Proactive testing
Proactive lifestyle
It's not enough
It cannot be offset
So here we are
Hand in hand in hand
Your eyes
Haven't opened for days
Your breath
Has been labored for hours
Your skin
Cold and dry
Your face
Thin and gray
It's too soon, my love
We were not ready
We had so much to do
She and I look at each other
Tears swelling, falling
Your monitors
Change their tune
A constant tone
All waveforms, gone
A painful loss
For a moment, we did not breathe
A release, a tragedy
One third, cut away
Stolen
At least your soul took flight
From California
