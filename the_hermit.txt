The Hermit

Inspired by: The Fountain Tarot
Question: Where do you feel most at peace?
Quiet observation, withdraw into silent surroundings
Willingness to let go of fixed views for the sake of peace
reassessment, illumination, focused attention
Introspection, silence leading to clarity

The forest
Blanketing green and brown
A simple trail, really
But a complex objective
I've got miles to go
Before I set up for the night
Midafternoon
The sun begins its descent
I go in silence
Switchbacks and twists
Winds and turns
Ups and downs
Middle of nowhere
Middle of everywhere
Thoughts invade the silence
Some are sweet
Some are bittersweet
Some are heartbreaking
Heavy traffic for introspection
I came prepared for the trek
I came prepared to discover her
The one who got away
Out here, she is reborn
Out here, she and me
Reunited
Free
