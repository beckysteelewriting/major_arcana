Judgment

Inspired by: Guardian of the Night Tarot by MJ Cullinane

Prewriting meaning:
Question: Are you being transparent?
Shedding of the past, a transformation
A notable turning point
Examine your life as a whole: good, bad, and ugly
Open up, be honest, don't make excuses, or point fingers
Own up to our own actions, take responsibility to spark growth
