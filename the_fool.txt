The Fool

Inspired by: Guardian of the Night Tarot by MJ Cullinane

Prewriting meaning:
Question: Are you letting the fears/opinions of others prevent you from taking a leap of faith?
Let go of fear, suggesting a blind risk
Embrace the adventure, let go of expectations
Begin the journey without knowing the destination/outcome
Relinquish control and let events unfold
