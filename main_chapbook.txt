The World

Inspiration: Guardian of the Night Tarot by MJ Cullinane

----------------------------------------------------------

Dusk infiltrates the light between the trees
I breathe in
Crisp, cool, pine, juniper
Giant Sequoia shadows envelop
Our home, built together
The tinder crackles
Catches the twigs, the logs
Afire
My task is complete
Turning, my ears catch their song
Laughter from the patio
Their faces are joyful, content
Caught in an embrace
They see me
Hiking boots and soft pants
Tending to the fire
We all feel it
Grateful, proud
I breathe in
Our love, our world
Let's enjoy our lives
Together
