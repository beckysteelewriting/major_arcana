The Hierophant
Inspiration: Guardian of the Night tarot

_______________________________________________

It's generational
All of the things
I'm supposed to do and be
To never step outside
The rigid lines
They drew to define me
A good woman is
A Christian woman
One who submits and prays and obeys
A good daughter is
Selfless, a servant
Family is family and
That's how it stays

Get a job
Keep a job
Work until you can't work anymore
Anything less
And you're just a slob
Someone with nothing to be grateful for

Love one man
Only one and no more
Be everything to him
And have some children
And keep that job
And keep your God
And keep your house
And keep your figure
And keep your family
And keep your opinions
And keep your desires
And keep your lust
And keep your sanity
Because you must

I defy your traditions
But am I not still me?
Your eyes are open
But you do not want to see

I love one man
I love one woman
I never want children
I have earned job after job after job
I abandoned your god
I bought and sold that house
I cherish my changing figure
I disown my toxic family
I voice my opinions
I act on my desires
I savor my lust
And I still keep my sanity
Because I must

I reject convention
Because I must
Anything else
  Is suffocation
