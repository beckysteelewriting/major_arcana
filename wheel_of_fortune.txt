Wheel of Fortune

Inspiration: The Brady Tarot by Rachel Pollack

Pre-writing meaning:
Question: Are you playing roulette with your future, or are you making conscious, positive choices?
A turn of events, seemingly random and outside our control
May seem capricious and surprising, for good or bad, but some say it presages good fortune
How everything ties together
