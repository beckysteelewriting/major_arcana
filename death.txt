Death

Inspired by: Guardian of the Night Tarot by MJ Cullinane

Prewriting meaning:
Question: can you find the beauty you hold within, that part of you that's been with you since birth?
Life as you know it may be due for a shift
Close a chapter, move on, let go of something that has completed its course or no longer serves you
This opens the door for something new
"we do everything in our power to avoid what we fear the most" 
Avoidance is easy, but change and vulnerability to it are hard
Wisdom, protection, awareness, adaptability
