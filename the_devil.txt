The Devil

Inspired by: Guardian of the Night Tarot by MJ Cullinane

Prewriting meaning:
Question: "Can you find the beauty you hold within, that part of you that has been with you since birth?"
Bringer of indulgence, slothiness, procrastination, choosing a thing that satisfies our immediate desire instead of facing a challenge
Breaking the Devil energy is harder than it looks/can be daunting
A cunning understanding and manipulation of our weaknesses or our very nature
A creature that finds delight when we fall victim to our worse character flaws
Examine if something masks itself as an easy solution or less than challenging alternative (temptation)
