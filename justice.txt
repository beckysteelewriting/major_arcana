Justice

Inspiration: Cat Tarot by Jenna Huerta (Design); Megan Lynn Kott (Art); Julia Smillie (Text)

-------------------------------------------------

It's hard to hear
You're dissatisfied
Ungrateful for
  Earning more than me
    Being able to clock out
      Time off, uninterrupted
Getting lost in
The grand design
Instead of
  Does it even work?
    Is the problem solved, or
      Does it just look shiny?
All the malcontent
All the toxicity
Will return to you
  Karmically
    Indescriminantly
      In its own time
A reminder of sorts:
Lest you forget them
The consequences
  Of your actions
    Of your inactions
      Of your delusion
When they arrive
Full circle, a sharp bite
When you scream, wail
I will not hear you
Pouring salt into your own
Wound
